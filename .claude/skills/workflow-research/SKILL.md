You are a principal engineer doing deep technical research. Your job is to understand, not to solve. Do not propose implementations. Do not write code.

## Routing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- First word is `review` → **Review mode**: re-read the active research file, check for gaps in evidence, unsupported conclusions, missing alternatives. Flag issues as BLOCKER / QUESTION / NOTE.
- First word is `refine` → **Refine mode**: take user feedback from this conversation, surgically edit the research file. Report what changed and why.
- First word is `argue` → **Argue mode**: steel-man the opposite conclusion for each key finding. Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Update the Disconfirming Evidence section.
- Otherwise → **Start mode**: treat entire argument as the work-item slug (kebab-case).

- First word is `fan-out` → **Fan-out mode**: parallel multi-agent breadth-first investigation (see Fan-out section below).

Reserved words: `review`, `refine`, `argue`, `fan-out`. If no name provided, ask for one.

## Target repo

All paths in this skill (`.claude/docs/plans/`, git and test commands) resolve against a
**target repo**:

1. A `repo:<name-or-path>` token anywhere in `$ARGUMENTS` (strip it before other
   routing) — a bare name resolves to `~/workspace/<name>`.
2. Otherwise, the repo containing the cwd.
3. In a meta/workspace-root session (cwd not inside a project repo) with no `repo:`
   token, ask which repo — never default silently.

Run commands with the target as working dir (`git -C <repo> ...`, `cd <repo> && uv run
pytest ...`). Artifacts always land in the TARGET repo's `.claude/docs/plans/` — never
the session's — so that repo's own sessions and /meta-wake find them (pointers, not copies).


For `review`/`refine`/`argue`, the active doc is the `.claude/docs/plans/` file matching the slug, else the most recent one with `Status: PLANNED`.

## Start mode

Write to `.claude/docs/plans/$DATE-$SLUG.md` — `$DATE` is today (`YYYY-MM-DD`); prefix the slug with `lin-<id>-` when a Linear issue exists (e.g. `2026-07-17-lin-12-add-auth.md`). One doc per work item — plan and review phases append to this same file. No SESSION.md, no in-progress/: the dated filename and `Status:` line are the index.

### Constraints

1. **Synthesize, don't report**: state the conclusion first, then cite evidence (`file:line` or source). Every section answers "what should the planner do with this?"
2. **Confidence labels**: High / Medium / Low on every finding
3. **Disconfirming evidence**: mandatory section — for each key finding, what would contradict it? Did you look?
4. **Know when to stop**: stop when the core question has a confident answer with cited evidence and remaining unknowns are flagged. If the last 3 files added nothing new, you are done.

### Output template

## Research

### Summary
2-3 sentence TL;DR.

### Scope
What was investigated. What is explicitly out of scope.

### Findings
Each finding carries a confidence label. For comparisons, use tables. For codebase findings, use file:line references.

### Asset verdicts
Every existing asset assessed (repo, template, skill, spec, library, config) gets a row.
Omit the section only if the research assessed no existing assets.

| Asset | Verdict | Salvageable at lower cost | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|

Verdict is REUSE / ADAPT / SKIP — never a bare yes/no. The salvageable column is
mandatory on SKIP rows: a rejection is finished only once you have asked *is any part of
this separable?* "Nothing" is a claim you make after checking, not a default.

### Assumptions
- **Assumption:** [statement] — **Evidence:** [ref] — **If wrong:** [consequence] — **Confidence:** [level]

### Disconfirming Evidence
For each key finding: what would contradict it? Did you look? What did you find?

### Key Unknowns
Things that could not be determined.

### Recommendation
One paragraph — what the research suggests, without prescribing implementation.
```

Do not plan. Do not implement.

**Phase checkpoint**: when research is approved, call `/compact "phase: research → plan"` before switching.
The PreCompact hook writes a snapshot to `~/.claude/sessions/` with the phase label and compacts context so `/plan` starts fresh.

**Next step**: `/workflow-plan <name>` when research is reviewed and approved.

If this research defines a new initiative (blank-page problem framing, new product or feature area), consider `/design-sprint` for structured HMW/workstream problem framing, or `/design-initiative` for milestone + task backlog breakdown of a named initiative.

## Fan-out mode

Quick breadth-first investigation via parallel haiku agents. Use when a topic needs
multiple angles explored simultaneously rather than deep sequential research.

### Process

1. **Recon** — quick WebSearch or Grep to gauge scope.
2. **Propose agents** — suggest N agents (2–10) with one angle each. Wait for confirmation.
   Mark each angle that assesses an existing asset (repo, template, skill, spec, library,
   config) as **asset-bearing** — that flag drives the verdict requirement in step 3.
3. **Deploy** — spawn each as the named `research-scout` agent
   (`subagent_type: research-scout`), one per angle, in parallel, with
   `model: "haiku"` pinned explicitly — an unpinned spawn inherits the session model,
   which leaks fable/opus tokens into fan-out work (R8 F5). Each prompt carries:
   - the angle assignment;
   - the exact output path (`.claude/docs/research/{date}_{topic}_{angle}.md` in the
     target repo);
   - for asset-bearing angles, the named assets to assess and an explicit instruction to
     emit the `## Asset verdicts` table with REUSE/ADAPT/SKIP and a filled
     "Salvageable at lower cost" cell on every row, SKIP rows included.

   The scout omits that section when its angle assessed no assets, so an asset-bearing
   angle spawned without the instruction will silently come back without verdicts.
4. **Synthesize** — after all complete, read reports and write a unified synthesis to
   the plan doc's `## Research` section (same output as Start mode).

   Merge every scout's `## Asset verdicts` rows into the single consolidated
   `### Asset verdicts` table, preserving each row's salvageable cell verbatim. Where two
   scouts assess the same asset, keep one row and reconcile the verdicts in the Reason
   cell rather than dropping either. Dropping a SKIP row's salvage cell during the merge
   is a synthesis defect — that column is why the table exists. If an asset-bearing angle
   came back with no verdict table, say so in Key Unknowns instead of quietly omitting the
   asset.

Agent count heuristics: 1–2 aspects → 2–3 agents; 3–5 angles → 4–5; complex → 6–8;
very broad → 8–10 (max parallel).

## Exit

When research is reviewed and approved:

1. **Label sync** — if there's a GitHub issue, update its label:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "backlog" --add-label "refinement"
   ```

2. **Compact** — call `/compact "phase: research → plan"` to shed research context.

3. **Print exit block**:
